## 🐛 If You Find Issues

**Don't worry! That's why we test!**

Just tell me:
1. What you were trying to do
2. What happened instead
3. Any error messages you saw
4. Your user role at the time

I'll fix it quickly and we'll retest.

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Use real scenarios** - Think about actual intern/supervisor workflows
- **Check all three sections** - Make sure A, B, and C all work
- **Test the full cycle** - Create → Submit → Review → Approve
- **Try the "return for edits"** - This is important for the bidirectional flow
- **Check the totals** - Weekly and cumulative hours should be correct

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# If servers aren't running:
cd "/Users/macdemac/Local Sites/PsychPATH/backend"
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

# In another terminal:
cd "/Users/macdemac/Local Sites/PsychPATH/frontend"
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 and start testing!
