PsychPATH Deployment

This repository contains the production-grade deployment configuration for PsychPATH, a full-stack web application built to support provisional psychologists and supervisors through milestone tracking, supervision workflows, and AHPRA-aligned reflection processes.

PsychPATH was previously known as CAPE and is now rebranded to reflect its expanded scope.

PsychPATH is built using a modern full-stack architecture:
	â€¢	Frontend: React (Vite + TypeScript)
	â€¢	Backend: Django + Django REST Framework
	â€¢	Database: PostgreSQL
	â€¢	Web Server: NGINX (reverse proxy)
	â€¢	Containerisation: Docker + Docker Compose
	â€¢	Infrastructure: Oracle Cloud (Ubuntu 22.04 VPS)

Notes
	â€¢	This app was previously named CAPE. You may still see cape_ prefixes in code or configuration, which will be updated over time.
	â€¢	Icons and branding assets will be updated in a future commit.
	â€¢	This repository focuses on infrastructure and functional deployment readiness. Frontend visual and branding elements may not yet reflect the final PsychPATH identity.
